        Instructions:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix all wet ingredients together until well combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a separate bowl, miz all dry ingredients except for the chocolate chips/rasins.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients (slowly) and mix in a little at a time until all
                combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add chocolate chips/rasins (if desired) and mix again. Cookie dough should be about the consistency of
                very thick pancake batter.
            </li>
            <li>
                Prepare one full-sized, two half-sized, or three quarter-sized cookie sheets with your choice of
                non-stick preparation (grease, cooking spray, parchment paper, baking mat, <a href="#note2">other
                    lubricant**</a>, etc.).
            </li>
            <li>
                Spoon batter into 24 cookies and bake for 15-17 minutes or until the center of the cookie rises back up
                when pushed down.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let cool and enjoy!

        Notes:
        <p id="note1">
            * To make pumpkin puree at home, use pumpkin boiled or roasted until soft and then puree. If you use canned
            puree, just note that the color of your cookies may come out different.
        </p>

        <p id="note2">
            ** Just so long as you don't use WD-40!
